- 👋 Hi, I’m @Asifkhan
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and front-end development, particularly using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, MySQL, and Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects, full-stack web applications, and any open-source development where I can leverage my skills in JavaScript, React, and database management.
- 📫  You can reach me via email at asif1502khan@gmail.com or on my phone at +91 83038710254.
